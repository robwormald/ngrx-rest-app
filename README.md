## Reactive RESTful Angular 2 application with ngrx store

A RESTful master-detail application built using Angular 2 and [ngrx store](https://github.com/ngrx/store).

### Getting Started

There are two main parts to this application. The first is the server which we are using `json-server` to simulate a REST api. The second part is the Angular 2 application which we will use `lite-server` to display.  

To get started run the commands below.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/simpulton/ngrx-rest-app.git
$ cd ngrx-rest-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
